description: "Check and migrate ltm.db from legacy ~/.claude/memory/ path to the marketplace plugin data directory."
---

Run and display output verbatim:

```bash
bun "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/migrate-db.ts"
```

If `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is unset, find plugin root: `claude plugin info ltm 2>/dev/null | grep -i path | head -1`.

## What it checks

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| `LTM_DB_PATH` env set | Shows override path, no migration needed |
| Marketplace install, DB already migrated | Confirms target path and size |
| Marketplace install, legacy DB exists | Copies `~/.claude/memory/ltm.db` → `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/ltm.db` |
| Marketplace install, fresh | Confirms where DB will be created |
| Dev/git-clone install | Shows `~/.claude/memory/ltm.db`, no migration needed |

## After migration

The legacy DB at `~/.claude/memory/ltm.db` is kept intact — delete it manually if desired.
All hooks and MCP tools automatically use the new path via `getDbPath()`.
