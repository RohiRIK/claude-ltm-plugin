# ContinuousLearning

SQLite-backed memory system at `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/ltm.db`. Two tables: `memories` (global learned insights) and `context_items` (per-project goals/decisions/progress/gotchas).

## Workflow Routing

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| "Learn this", "Remember this", "Save this pattern" | Run `/learn` |
| "What do I know about X?", "Any past decisions on Y?" | Run `/recall` |
| "Forget about X", "That memory is wrong" | Run `/forget` |
| "X supports Y", "X contradicts Y" | Run `/relate` |

## Quick Reference

- **`/learn`** — Store an insight in `memories` table. Dedup-safe (reinforces on repeat).
- **`/recall [query]`** — FTS5 search with tag/category/project filters.
- **`/forget <id>`** — Delete by ID. CASCADE removes relations. Irreversible.
- **`/relate <src> <tgt> <type>`** — Link memories. Types: `supports|contradicts|refines|depends_on|related_to|supersedes`.
- **Hooks manage context automatically** — no manual writes to `context-*.md` files needed.
